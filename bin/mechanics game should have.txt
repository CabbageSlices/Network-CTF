When player has a flag a marker should draw over his indicating he has a flag


All background objects, that is blocks and anything that players can collide with but not hide behind, should be predrawn, and the collision boxes will be added later



***done***Add an underground system, add tags for all entities that indicate whether its underground or overground and things can only collide with things in the same plane
	***done***-things in the underground are only drawn if the player is underground

***done***Add a Minimap
	***done***-in minimap you can see the whole level except for underground parts
	***done***-you can see the flags unless they're being held
	***done***-In the minimap you can always see your teammates, however you can't see players of the other team unless they are close to your teammates


***done***Guns should have ammo capacity and reloading
***done***keep track of how many kills, deaths, flag captures, and flag returns each player has
***done***when your teammates are hiding make the foreground they are hiding in, visible so that you too can see whats inside.
***done***Be able to pick up different weapons on the ground
	***done***-start off with pistol and pick up different guns from the ground to replace their current gun
	***done***-if you pick up a gun that you are currently holding you replenish your ammo
	
	***done***types of guns
	***done***-pistol, basic automatic gun, 10 - 20% health damage (undecided), can kill one person before reloading
	***done***-shotgun, spread shot, each bullet does 5 - 10% damage, terrible long range accuracy. maybe 2 - 3 shots before reloading
	***done***-sniper, 2 bullets, each does more than 50% damage, high accuracy, long reload times

***done***Add spawn zones for each team, heal in spawn zones
	***done***-each teams side should have a spawn area. in this area they can spawn randomly at any position in the area
	***done***-while in the spawn zones players regenerate health slowly
