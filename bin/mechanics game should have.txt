Be able to pick up different weapons on the ground
	-start off with pistol and pick up different guns from the ground to replace their current gun
	-if you pick up a gun that you are currently holding you replenish your ammo
	
	***done***types of guns
		-pistol, basic automatic gun, 10 - 20% health damage (undecided), can kill one person before reloading
		-shotgun, spread shot, each bullet does 5 - 10% damage, terrible long range accuracy. maybe 2 - 3 shots before reloading
		-sniper, 2 bullets, each does more than 50% damage, high accuracy, long reload times

Guns should have ammo capacity and reloading

Add spawn zones for each team, heal in spawn zones
	-each teams side should have a spawn area. in this area they can spawn randomly at any position in the area
	-while in the spawn zones players regenerate health slowly

All background objects, that is blocks and anything that players can collide with but not hide behind, should be predrawn, and the collision boxes will be added later

Add an underground system, add tags for all entities that indicate whether its underground or overground and things can only collide with things in the same plane
	-things in the underground are only drawn if the player is underground

Add a Minimap
	-in minimap you can see the whole level except for underground parts
	-you can see the flags at all time except when its underground
	***done***-In the minimap you can always see your teammates, however you can't see players of the other team unless they are close to your teammates







***done***keep track of how many kills, deaths, flag captures, and flag returns each player has
***done***when your teammates are hiding make the foreground they are hiding in, visible so that you too can see whats inside.
